            Hello Everyone,
            <br />
            Our new project is now underway, and, as you know, we've decided to
            implement it using Scrum.
            <br />
            Some of you might know about this framework already, while others
            might not. Whether you're familiar with Scrum or not, there's always
            more to learn that can help our work.
            <br />
            Over the next few emails, we'll delve into the core concepts of
            Scrum and discuss how they can enhance our team dynamics and project
            outcomes. I encourage everyone to actively engage in this
            discussion, sharing insights and experiences as we explore this
            framework.
            <br />
            Let's embark on this journey together towards improved teamwork and
            outcomes.

            The term "<i>Scrum</i>" is inspired by the scrum formation in the
            sport of rugby, where the team collaborates to move the ball
            forward. Similarly, in Scrum, the team works together to move the
            product forward.
            <br />
            Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and
            sustaining complex products. The Scrum framework is purposefully
            incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum
            theory. Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the
            people using it. Rather than provide people with detailed
            instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and
            interactions.
            <br />
            Various processes, techniques, and methods can be employed within
            the framework. Scrum wraps around existing practices or renders them
            unnecessary. Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current
            management, environment, and work techniques so that improvements
            can be made.

          <h3 class="heading">THE SCRUM THEORY</h3>
          <p>
            In complex environments where there is uncertainty and incomplete
            information, making a decision is often preferable to not making any
            decision at all. This is because inaction can lead to delays and
            missed opportunities.
            <br />
            Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts
            that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on
            what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the
            essentials.
            <br />
            Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize
            predictability and to control risk. Scrum engages groups of people
            who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work
            and share or acquire such skills as needed.
            <br />
            Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation
            within a containing event, the Sprint. These events work because
            they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency,
            inspection, and adaptation.

          <p>
            The 3 empirical pillars of Scum are - Transparency, Inspection, and
            Adaptation.
          </p>

          <div>
            <strong>Transparency</strong>
            <p>
              The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing
              the work as well as those receiving the work. With Scrum,
              important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three
              formal artifacts, artifacts that have low transparency can lead to
              decisions that diminish value and increase risk. Transparency
              enables inspection; inspection without transparency is misleading
              and wasteful.
              <br />
              In Scrum, transparency is implemented in the Artifacts and having
              the Scrum Events to help people to be aware of what is going on.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>Inspection</strong>
            <p>
              Inspection characterizes the empirical Scrum nature of testing
              hypotheses. It is about planning and trying something, checking
              what happens, learning from it, and adapting. The Scrum artifacts
              and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently
              and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or
              problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the
              form of its five events.
              <br />
              Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is
              considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>Adaptation</strong>
            <p>
              If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or
              if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being
              applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The
              adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further
              deviation.
              <br />
              Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not
              empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the
              moment it learns anything new through inspection.
              <br />
              In Scrum, adaptation occurs throughout the Sprint as needed, not
              just limited to a specific Scrum event.

          <h3 class="heading">SCRUM VALUES</h3>
          <p>
            Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient
            in living five values:
            <br /><br />
            <i class="bi bi-bank"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Commitment</strong> - The
            Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each
            other.
            <br />
            <i class="bi bi-bullseye"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Focus</strong> - The
            Scrum Team's primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the
            best possible progress toward these goals.
            <br />
            <i class="bi bi-unlock"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Openness</strong> - The
            Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the
            challenges.
            <br />
            <i class="bi bi-people"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Respect</strong> - Scrum
            Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people,
            and are respected as such by the people with whom they work.
            <br />
            <i class="bi bi-rocket-takeoff"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Courage</strong> -
            The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to
            work on tough problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their
            work, actions, and behavior. The decisions that are made, the steps
            taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not
            diminish or undermine them. The Scrum Team members learn and explore
            the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts. When
            these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work
            with, the empirical Scrum pillars come to life, building trust.

            Resistance to change is common when people feel it disrupts their
            routines responsibilities, or comfort zones.
            <br />
            Introducing Scrum in organizations often presents challenges, as it
            necessitates a substantial shift in mindset, culture, and
            operational practices. It means moving from traditional hierarchical
            structures to self-managing teams and valuing bottom-up
            intelligence. Moreover, it requires the commitment and support of
            stakeholders at all organizational levels. Overcoming resistance and
            fear of change is key to successfully implementing Scrum.

          <p>
            Stakeholders are crucial in Scrum, as they're impacted by the
            product and invested in its progress. It is essential for them to
            understand Scrum principles for effective collaboration with the
            Scrum Team, offer feedback, and make informed choices. This
            understanding leads to transparency, better communication, and

            Management external to the Scrum Team doesn't directly participate
            in product development but plays a crucial role in guiding the
            organization's vision and strategy. They support bottom-up
            intelligence and provide the team with insights, resources, and an
            environment necessary for being efficient. By fostering trust and
            collaboration, they empower the team to be self-managing, encourage
            ownership, collective decision-making, and help the team deliver
            value and improve continuously. By cultivating trust and
            collaboration, management empowers the team to self-manage,

          <h3 class="heading">CHANGING SCRUM TERMINOLOGY</h3>
          <p>
            Scrum uses specific terminology to define its accountabilities,
            events, artifacts, and rules. This is to create a common language
            and understanding within teams, aiding in the adoption of Scrum
            practices. Organizations may alter this terminology to match their
            culture or improve comprehension among team members. However,
            changing the terms without clear communication can hinder actual
            change and lead to lost benefits. While using familiar language may
            ease the transition, it's crucial to ensure that the new terms do
            not cause confusion or miscommunication. Clarity and shared
            understanding of Scrum concepts are essential for successful
            implementation.

          <p>
            Hardening sprints, integration sprints, release sprints, and sprint
            zero are not permitted in Scrum, as they contradict the fundamental
            principles of delivering a valuable Increment each Sprint. These
            practices may lead to inefficiencies, delays, and a deviation from
            Scrum's iterative and incremental approach, potentially undermining
            the core principle of empiricism.

          <p>
            According to the Scrum Guide, the Scrum framework is immutable.
            While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is
            not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a
            container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices.
            <br />
            Scrum is adaptable but not for every problem. It works best in
            complex environments. It improves predictability but doesn't
            guarantee on-time delivery due to product development complexities.
            <br />
            While Scrum can speed up delivery, its main focus is continuous
            delivery of valuable 'Done' Increments. To measure Scrum success,
            the focus should be on customer value, team improvement, and
            sustainable delivery, instead of outputs.
