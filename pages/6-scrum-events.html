            Scrum Events are essential elements of the Scrum framework that
            provide structure and opportunities for collaboration within a Scrum
            team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scrum prescribes 5 events - The <i>Sprint</i>, which is a container
            for all other Scrum Events, namely <i>Sprint Planning</i>,
            <i>Daily Scrum</i>, <i>Sprint Review</i>, and
            <i>Sprint Retrospective</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt
            Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to enable
            the transparency required. Failure to operate any events as
            prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt.
            Events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the
            need for meetings not defined in Scrum.

          <h3 class="heading">PURPOSE</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose of Scrum Events is to provide opportunities for
            collaboration, inspection, and adaptation throughout the development
            process, helping the Scrum Team to deliver valuable increments of
            work iteratively and incrementally. These events foster
            transparency, communication, and continuous improvement, enabling
            the team to respond effectively to changing requirements and deliver
            high-quality products or services.
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>Here is a high level description of each event:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: none">
              <li>
                <strong
                  ><i class="bi bi-calendar-event-fill"></i>&nbsp;Sprint</strong
                >
                - All work in Scrum is done in a series of short projects called
                Sprints. This enables rapid feedback loops.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  ><i class="bi bi-calendar-event-fill"></i>&nbsp;Sprint
                  Planning</strong
                >
                - The Sprint starts with a planning session in which the
                Developers plan the work they intend to do in the Sprint. This
                plan creates a shared understanding and alignment among the
                team.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  ><i class="bi bi-calendar-event-fill"></i>&nbsp;Daily
                  Scrum</strong
                >
                - The Developers meet daily to inspect their progress toward the
                Sprint Goal, discuss any challenges they've run into and tweak
                their plan for the next day as needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  ><i class="bi bi-calendar-event-fill"></i>&nbsp;Sprint
                  Review</strong
                >
                - At the end of the Sprint, the Sprint Team meets with
                stakeholders to show what they have accomplished and get
                feedback.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  ><i class="bi bi-calendar-event-fill"></i>&nbsp;Sprint
                  Retrospective</strong
                >
                - Finally, the Scrum Team gets together to discuss how the
                Sprint went and if there are things they could do differently
                and improve in the next Sprint.
              </li>

          <h3 class="heading">TIME CONSTRAINTS</h3>
          <p>
            All Scrum Events are time-boxed. A time-box is a predefined period
            allocated for an activity or event. When an event has a timebox, it
            means that it cannot exceed a maximum duration. This is to help
            create discipline and ensure that the team remains focused and
            productive.
            <br />
            Driving focus into the timeboxed events is a discipline that allows
            team members to spend less time in meetings, freeing them to spend
            more time doing other work.
          </p>
          <p>
            When teams are unable to achieve the purpose of the event in the
            timebox, the team should investigate where they can find
            opportunities to improve how they conduct their events.
          </p>
          <p>
            Optimally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce
            complexity. Except for the Sprint, the remaining events, can finish
            before the time-box elapses if their purpose has been achieved.

          <p>
            The following is a quick summary of the timeboxed Scrum events. The
            Sprint is a container for all of these events and is required to
            have a maximum duration of one month or less.

          <h3 class="heading">COMMON ANTIPATTERNS</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose, timebox and participants of each of the Scrum events
            are well defined. However, we sometimes see Scrum Teams fall into
            antipatterns that diminish their value.
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style: none">
            <li>
              <strong
                ><i class="bi bi-exclamation-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;Events that
                consistently exceed their timebox</strong
              >
              <br />
              This can happen when participants lose sight of the purpose of the
              event. Often teams deviate into additional conversations, rather
              than sticking to the purpose of the meeting and scheduling another
              meeting to create solutions to issues uncovered during the event.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong

                members are "heard"</strong
              >
              <br />
              When team members do not feel comfortable providing their
              thoughts, the team will not benefit from their skills and
              experience, and the value of the event is diminished.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                ><i class="bi bi-exclamation-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;The Scrum
                Master drives the discussion and team members direct their
                comments to the Scrum Master</strong
              >
              <br />
              Each of the Scrum events has a distinct purpose, they are all
              designed for the participants to work together to inspect and
              adapt their progress toward the Product or Sprint Goal. The Scrum
              Master's role is to help the team achieve the purpose of each
              event.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                ><i class="bi bi-exclamation-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;The Scrum
                events turn into status meetings</strong
              >
              <br />
              None of the events are status meetings, they are all intended to
              help the team progress toward the Product or Sprint Goal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                ><i class="bi bi-exclamation-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;The team
                decides to eliminate some events because they feel that Scrum is
                meeting heavy</strong
              >
              <br />
              Every Scrum event has a purpose and every team member is
              accountable for making each event productive. Continuous
              improvement helps the team become more effective and purposeful
              over time. If the team finds that they are conducting Sprint
              Planning, Sprint Reviews and Sprint Retrospectives too frequently
              and are receiving limited value, it may be time to consider
              extending the length of the Sprint. This should be done with
              caution since a basic tenet of Scrum is the frequent opportunities
              for inspection and adaptation.

              >
              <br />
              Scrum events are predetermined opportunities for inspection and
              adaptation. However, if the team discovers the need for
              adaptation, they should execute the change as soon as they
              practically can.

              >
              <br />
              The Scrum Events can be facilitated by any team member, no one has
              the official responsibility to be the meeting facilitator. That
              said, individuals who chose to be Scrum Masters often chose to
              develop their facilitation skills and may be called upon to lead
              certain events.

              <br />
              Scrum teams will often have to collaborate on problems and
              challenges that arise during their work. Having separate meetings,
              each focused on a specific challenge, helps the team brainstorm
              and align on optimal solutions.

              Developers have specialized skills, knowledge and experience that

              always added through the Developers participation.
