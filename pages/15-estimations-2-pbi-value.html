            Defining the value of a Product Backlog item in Scrum is crucial for
            effective prioritization and decision-making throughout the
            development process. The Scrum Guide does not prescribe any
            technique for this purpose, and it is up to the Product Owner to
            define which technique to use for this purpose. One such technique
            is the <i>Kano Model</i>.

          <h3 class="heading">THE KANO MODEL</h3>
          <p>
            The Kano Model is a theory developed by Professor Noriaki Kano in
            the 1980s to understand and prioritize customer preferences in
            product development. It categorizes features into three main types:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><i class="bi bi-box-fill"></i>&nbsp;Basic Needs:</strong>
            These are essential features that customers expect as a minimum
            requirement. They don't necessarily delight customers when present,
            but their absence can lead to dissatisfaction. <br />Examples of
            such features in a smartphone might include basic functionality like
            making calls, sending text messages, and connecting to the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-box-fill"></i>&nbsp;Performance Needs:</strong
            >
            These are features that directly correlate with customer
            satisfaction. The more of these features a product has, the more
            satisfied customers are. However, there's diminishing returnsâ€”adding
            more of these features doesn't necessarily lead to increased
            satisfaction. <br />Examples of such features in a smartphone might
            include battery life, processing speed, or screen resolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-box-fill"></i>&nbsp;Excitement Needs:</strong
            >
            These are unexpected or innovative features that can delight
            customers and significantly increase their satisfaction when
            present, but their absence doesn't lead to dissatisfaction.
            <br />Examples of such features in a smartphone might include a
            built-in virtual assistant, innovative camera features, or
            customizable user interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Kano Model suggests that customer needs evolve over time, so
            what was once considered an <i>excitement need</i> can become a
            <i>performance need</i> and eventually a <i>basic need</i>.
            Understanding and adapting to these changing needs is crucial for
            maintaining customer satisfaction and staying competitive in the
            market.

            HOW DO WE USE KANO MODEL TO ORDER THE PRODUCT BACKLOG ITEMS
          </h3>
          <p>
            In Scrum Product Backlog refinement, the Kano Model can be applied
            during the prioritization of backlog items. Here's how:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-dropbox"></i>&nbsp;Identify Feature
              Types:</strong
            >
            When refining the product backlog, the team can categorize backlog
            items into these three types based on customer feedback, market
            analysis, and product vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-dropbox"></i>&nbsp;Prioritize Backlog
              Items:</strong
            >
            Prioritize backlog items based on their Kano type.
            <i>Basic needs</i> should be addressed first to ensure customer
            satisfaction and avoid dissatisfaction. Then, focus on
            <i>performance needs</i> to improve satisfaction further. Finally,
            incorporate <i>excitement needs</i> to delight customers and
            differentiate the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-dropbox"></i>&nbsp;Iterative Refinement:</strong
            >
            As the product evolves and more feedback is gathered, continue
            refining the backlog items based on their Kano types. This ensures
            that the product remains aligned with customer preferences and
            market demands.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Understanding these categories can help product teams prioritize
            features more effectively, leading to higher customer satisfaction
            and a more successful product.
