            Hello Everyone,
            <br />
            Our new project has officially started and we have chosen Scrum as
            the framework for implementation. Some of you may already be
            familiar with it, while others may be encountering it for the first.
            <br />
            Scrum is a framework that fosters collaboration, transparency, and
            adaptability, allowing teams to tackle complex projects with greater
            efficiency and focus. Whether you're new to Scrum or have prior
            experience, I believe there's always something new to learn and
            apply to our work.
            <br />
            Over the next few emails, we'll delve into the core concepts of
            Scrum and discuss how they can enhance our team dynamics and project
            outcomes. 
            <br />
            I encourage everyone to actively engage in this
            discussion, sharing insights and experiences as we explore this
            framework together.
            <br />
            Let's embark on this journey together towards improved teamwork and
            outcomes.
