            The Sprint Review is a key event within the Scrum framework,
            designed to inspect and adapt the product increment created during
            the Sprint. This the second to last event of the Sprint and is
            timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For
            shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

          <h3 class="heading">PURPOSE</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the
            Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the
            results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the
            Product Goal is discussed. This collaborative environment fosters
            transparency and ensures that everyone involved has a shared
            understanding of the product and its direction.

          <h3 class="heading">PARTICIPANTS</h3>
          <p>
            The Sprint Review involves the Scrum Team (including the Product
            Owner (PO), the Development Team, and the Scrum Master), and
            relevant stakeholders such as customers, users, management, and
            anyone else with an interest in the product.
          </p>

      <div class="row mt-2">
        <div class="col">
          <h3 class="heading">AGENDA</h3>
          <p>
            A common mistake teams make in conducting Sprint Reviews is for the
            PO to deliver a presentation of the work done during the Sprint to
            an audience of stakeholders. This eliminates one of the most
            powerful tools in Scrum: frequent stakeholder feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, the entire Scrum Team should approach the Sprint Review as
            a way to collaborate with stakeholders on the value they've created
            and how they should adapt their future plans in a way that will
            create even more value.
          </p>
          <p>It's important to plan the review in advance. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The team should decide what will be reviewed and discussed.
              Remember: only work that has met the Definition of Done (DoD) can
              be reviewed during the Sprint Review.
            </li>
            <li>
              Based on what is being discussed at the review, someone on the
              team, often the PO, will make certain that the correct
              stakeholders are invited to the Sprint Review.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's good practice for the Scrum Team to identify the next
              important thing they want to learn and plan to get feedback on
              that.
            </li>
            <li>
              For every item to be discussed during the review, it's best if a
              member of the team is assigned the job of leading and focusing the
              discussion. Often, the person leading the discussion is the
              Developer (or Developers) who worked on that item. It's usually a
              bad idea for the PO to lead the discussion on all the topics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Anyone can be the facilitator of the Sprint Review; they can be a
              member of the Scrum Team, one of the stakeholders, or someone not
              involved in the project at all. Often, the PO facilitates the
              Sprint Review since they are the stakeholder representatives for
              the Scrum Team during the Sprint and they are often best at
              speaking the customer's language.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There are many different ways to conduct the Sprint Review itself
            and there are no prescribed formats. However, it important that the
            purpose of the review is fulfilled.
            <br />The Scrum Team and stakeholders should:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Inspect the outcome of the Sprint.</li>
            <li>Discuss the progress toward the Product Goal.</li>
            <li>
              Discuss any changes in the environment, such as changes in the
              marketplace, customer behavior and customer feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborate on what to do next. Consider what the next most
              valuable thing to do is and update the Product Backlog.
            </li>

          <h3 class="heading">COMMON ANTIPATTERNS</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose, timebox and participants of the Sprint Review are well
            defined. However, we sometimes see Scrum Teams fall into
            antipatterns that diminish their value.

                meeting, demo or one-way presentation</strong
              >
              <br />Instead, It should be an opportunity for the PO &
              stakeholders to shape the future direction of the product.

              <br />
              Sometimes what is presented does not meet the team's quality
              standards and only a portion of the product is demonstrated. In
              either case, the stakeholders are put at a disadvantage when
              providing feedback.

              <br />It's a myth that a successful Sprint Review is one where the
              PO signs off on the work. The PO should work with the team
              throughout the Sprint and nothing should be a surprise at the
              Sprint Review.

              <br />
              By missing the Sprint Review, the Developers miss the opportunity
              to receive stakeholder feedback directly and will miss the context
              around any decisions about changes to the Product Backlog and what
              to do next.

              Often colleagues and management will act as a proxy for the
              product's customers. Finding customers that are well-suited to
              review a product while it's in development is not always an easy
              task, but it's rewarding when it happens.

            Breaking the antipatterns listed above help create strong and

              <strong
                ><i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;Ensure the

              >&nbsp;Developers should resist the temptation to delve too much

              <strong

                was Done and not Done</strong
              >
              - The team gives a summary of what was Done in the Sprint, and
              what was not done and moved back into the Product Backlog. Keep
              the DoD visible to provide transparency on this topic.

            <li>
              <strong

                Sprint went</strong
              >
              - The Developers share any issues they had during the Sprint and
              what actions were taken to overcome them. Include an opportunity
              to discuss impediments that can't be resolved by the Scrum Team.
              By engaging stakeholders, the team can use the event to develop
              close partnerships with stakeholders.

                feedback</strong

              - The Developers show stakeholders what was done in order to
              gather feedback on the value of what was completed. This feedback
              helps the Developers and the PO assess whether the assumptions
              they made were right or wrong.

              - The PO presents the current state of the backlog including PBIs
              that were not completed in the Sprint. Based on the feedback
              received from the stakeholders, new opportunities may be
              identified, discussed together and potentially added to the

            Overall, the Sprint Review is a crucial ceremony in Scrum that
            promotes collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement. By
            regularly gathering feedback and inspecting the product increment,
            the Scrum Team can ensure that they're delivering value to
            stakeholders and continuously refining the product to meet evolving
            needs.
