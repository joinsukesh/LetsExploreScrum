            In order to deliver functioning product increments on a regular
            basis, Scrum requires that teams track and manage progress
            throughout the project. Various practices exist to forecast
            progress, like burndowns, burnups, or cumulative flows. While
            proving useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism.

          <h3 class="heading">BURNDOWN CHART</h3>
          <p>
            A burndown chart is a visual depiction of the remaining work within
            a Sprint, plotted over time. It offers a clear indication of the
            team's progress and highlights any deviations from the planned
            schedule. As tasks are completed, the chart gradually diminishes to
            zero by the end of the designated time frame.
            <br />While not mandated by Scrum, burndown charts serve as valuable
            tools for monitoring progress and ensuring transparency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea behind the burndown chart is to gradually reduce the
            remaining work, starting from the top and progressing downwards
            until the goal is achieved. Typically, this goal involves delivering
            the Product or Sprint Backlog. Thus, the initial workload is
            represented by the total points assigned to the Product or Sprint
            Backlog.

          <h4>How to create a Sprint burndown chart</h4>
          <div class="mt-3">
            <img
              src="../img/burndown.png"

          <div class="mt-3">
            <p>
              The Y-axis is for effort, generally measured in story points
              (SPs). The X-axis is for time, generally measured in days, hours,
              Sprints.
              <br />The Scrum Team could use any other units here, whatever they
              find useful.
            </p>

            <p>
              The ideal effort (blue line) represents what the burndown chart
              will look like if the estimated work is completed on time.
              <br />Initially, the total estimated work is represented at the
              top of the Y-axis, serving as the starting point. <br />
              For example, if the team estimates that they will complete 20 SPs,
              the number 20 is plotted at the top of the Y-axis. A finishing
              point is marked on the X-axis, representing the point where all
              work is estimated to be completed. A straight diagonal line from
              the starting point to the finishing point represents the expected
              “burndown” slope if the work is completed on time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each day, the team updates and plots the progress against the work
              remaining. These updates represent the remaining effort (yellow
              line) compared to the ideal effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if the Sprint Backlog initially comprises 20 SPs, 20
              is plotted at X=0 and Y=20, indicating the starting workload. If,
              after the first day, 19 points remain, another point is marked at
              X=1 and Y=19.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideally, the remaining effort would line up with the ideal effort.
              In reality, some work will be marked below the ideal effort line
              (indicating that the team is ahead of schedule), and other work
              will be marked above the line (indicating that the team is behind
              schedule).
            </p>

            <p>
              By comparing the estimated and actual work lines, the team
              assesses whether the project is on track or behind schedule.
            </p>

            <p>
              For a Product burndown chart, the amount of work remaining in the
              Product Backlog over time, is represented on the Y-axis by the
              number of Product Backlog Items, and the Sprints on the X-axis.

          <h3 class="heading">BURNUP CHART</h3>
          <p>
            A burnup chart visually represents a team's progress throughout a
            project's duration. It provides project managers and teams with a
            clear overview of workload progression and whether the project is on
            track for completion.
            <br />
            Unlike the downward progression of a burndown chart, the burnup
            chart moves upward from bottom to top, which explains its name.
          </p>
          <p>
            The chart typically displays two main lines: one representing the
            total planned project work (blue line) and the other tracking the
            work completed up to the current point (orange line). By comparing
            the team's completed work with the overall planned workload, one can
            gauge their efficiency and make more accurate estimates regarding
            the remaining work's duration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Burnup charts prioritize showcasing cumulative achievements over
            time rather than emphasizing specific deadlines.

              number or the timeframe.
              <br />At the top, a blue line indicates the total intended SPs to
              be achieved by the project's conclusion. <br />A dotted black line
              marks the projected completion of SPs. <br />
              The orange line tracks the actual number of SPs completed.

            <p>
              Here are some important points to consider when analyzing a burnup

            <ul>
              <li>

                from the project.
              </li>
              <li>
                Alterations in the black line signal adjustments to the baseline
                plan regarding the amount of work planned for each Sprint.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the orange line falls below the black line, it indicates that
                the project is lagging behind schedule.
              </li>
              <li>
                Conversely, if the orange line surpasses the black line, it
                suggests that the project is ahead of schedule.

            </li>
            <li>
              By comparing the planned work against the actual progress, the
              burnup chart helps teams identify any deviations or obstacles
              early in the Sprint. This allows them to take corrective actions

            <li>
              The chart helps teams forecast whether they are on track to
              complete all planned work by the end of the Sprint. By
              extrapolating the current velocity, teams can estimate whether
              they will finish all committed items or if adjustments need to be
              made to ensure successful Sprint completion.

              Visualizing progress can be motivating for team members as they
              see tasks being completed and the Sprint goal getting closer. It

            their transition from the initial "to-do" stage to completion.
            <br />The Y-axis indicates the number of tasks being actively worked

            passage of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The graph is divided into three color-coded bars namely: To Do

          <p>
            To meet our goals and consistently deliver high-quality products
            within tight timelines, it's crucial to understand the team's
            capacity to complete tasks within each Sprint. This insight allows
            us to more accurately predict project completion timelines and
            ensures that we allocate resources optimally to support the team's
            efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            By analyzing the team's historical Sprint performance, we can
            estimate their future capacity, which is commonly referred to as
            Sprint velocity in Agile development. With this knowledge, we can
            effectively plan projects and anticipate the workload for upcoming
            Sprints.
            <br />Additionally, it enables us to better forecast resource
            requirements and project completion efforts. Sharing our Sprint
            velocity estimate with stakeholders provides them with a clearer
            understanding of when to expect product delivery.

          <h4>How to estimate Sprint velocity</h4>
          <p>
            Assessing past achievements is crucial for predicting future work
            completion. To obtain an accurate average of completed tasks, it's
            advisable to review past Sprints, at least the last three.
          </p>
          <p>
            Estimating Sprint velocity involves averaging the completed work
            from previous Sprints, measured in SPs. For instance, if Sprint 1,
            2, and 3 yielded 20, 30, and 40 SPs respectively, the average Sprint
            velocity would be (20 + 30 + 40)/3, equating to 30 SPs.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's vital to only include SPs from "Done" work, i.e., stories
            meeting the Definition of Done criteria.
          </p>
          <p>
            This average Sprint velocity of 30 SPs can then guide future Sprint
            planning. For instance, if there are 150 SPs remaining in the
            project, it suggests the team may need around five more Sprints to
            complete the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this estimation is contingent on factors like team size,
            project complexity, and scope remaining consistent. Teams typically
            encounter fluctuations from one Sprint to another. Nevertheless,
            Sprint velocity estimation serves as a useful starting point for
            gauging the team's capacity.

            For Agile teams new to the process, lacking past Sprint data,
            completing a few initial Sprints while tracking completed SPs is
            necessary. This data accumulation enables the calculation of an
            average Sprint velocity.

          <p>
            It's essential to remember that Sprint velocity is an estimation and
            shouldn't be solely relied upon to predict what the team will
            deliver. Actual completed SPs may deviate from the estimated figure.
