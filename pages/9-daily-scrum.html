            The Daily Scrum is an event for the Developers of the Scrum Team
            that occurs every working day of the Sprint. This is a time-boxed
            15-minute meeting, regardless of the Sprint's duration. To reduce
            complexity, it is held at the same time and place. This consistency
            facilitates efficient daily planning, encourages punctuality, and
            improves time management within the team.

          <h3 class="heading">PURPOSE</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the
            Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the
            upcoming planned work.
            <br />
            The Daily Scrum ensures that all team members are aligned, aware of
            any updates or changes and that the team is making progress toward
            the Sprint Goal.
            <br />
            Regular Daily Scrums enhance communication, pinpoint obstacles,
            promote swift decision-making, and thereby eliminate the necessity
            for additional meetings.
            <br />
            Note that, Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed
            to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more
            detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the
            Sprint's work.

          <h3 class="heading">PARTICIPANTS</h3>
          <p>
            All the Developers of the Scrum Team must be present at the Daily
            Scrum. While the Product Owner (PO) and Scrum Master may attend,
            they do so as observers unless they are actively working on items in
            the Sprint Backlog, in which case they participate as Developers.
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading">HOW SHOULD THIS MEETING BE CONDUCTED</h3>
          <p>
            It is the responsibility of the Developers themselves to conduct the
            Daily Scrum effectively. They can select whatever structure and
            techniques they want, as long as they are focused on progress toward
            the Sprint Goal and produce an actionable plan for the next day of
            work. This creates focus and improves self-management.
          </p>
          <p>
            Usually, most teams have each member answer three questions, to
            inspect their progress.
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style: none">
            <li>
              <i class="bi bi-question-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;What did I do
              yesterday that helped the team meet the Sprint Goal?
            </li>
            <li>
              <i class="bi bi-question-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;What will I do
              today to help the team meet the Sprint Goal?
            </li>
            <li>
              <i class="bi bi-question-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;Do I see any
              impediments that prevents me or the team from meeting the Sprint
              Goal?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Using these three questions as a guide to drive the meeting is just
            an example. The Developers determine the meeting's format.
            <br />
            To support decision-making, the Developers can monitor the Sprint
            progress by tracking the total remaining work. This may involve
            maintaining a Sprint Burndown chart, for example.
            <br />
            The PO should engage actively in the Daily Scrums and utilize this
            forum to offer clarification, and address any difficulties the
            Developers may have in comprehending the Product Backlog items in
            the Sprint Backlog. This proactive involvement facilitates prompt
            clarification and nurtures a collaborative atmosphere for the Scrum
            Team to work together effectively.
            <br />
            The Daily Scrum must take place each working day throughout the
            Sprints. Decreasing the frequency of this meeting could lead to
            various adverse effects, including fewer opportunities to inspect
            and adapt the Sprint Backlog, an outdated Sprint Backlog, and
            delayed detection and resolution of obstacles. These challenges
            could impact the team's ability to achieve the Sprint Goal.

          <p>
            Are you interested to know how the Daily Scrum came to be. Here is
            an excerpt from the book "<i
              >Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time</i
            >" by Jeff Sutherland, Inventor & Co-Creator of Scrum.

          >
            <p>
              With the first Scrum team at Easel Corporation in 1993, I
              regularly showed them a video of the All Blacks rugby team getting
              ready for a game. The All Blacks, a legendary team from the small
              country of New Zealand, are a transcendent team. Before every game
              they perform the Maori warrior ceremony of the haka. The haka is a
              warrior dance that charges up people about to go into battle.
              While watching it, you can almost see the energy come out of each
              player and coalesce into a greater whole. With synchronized
              stomping and clapping and chanting—ritualized movements of cutting
              an enemy's throat—you can see ordinary men transform themselves
              into something bigger, something greater. They're invoking a
              warrior spirit that does not accept defeat or dismay.
            </p>
            <p>
              It took a few viewings of the video, but my team of
              slightly-out-of-shape computer programmers eventually started to
              talk about how they could be that way.
            </p>
            <p>
              So they went into the literature to find out how the best teams
              did it. One of the great things about software development is that
              the situation early on was so bad, and so much money was being
              wasted—billions and billions each year—that people spent a lot of
              time studying why, and there was data on everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              One paper we found was an examination of a Borland Software
              Corporation project called Quattro Pro for Windows. For the
              project one million lines of software code had been created. They
              took thirty-one months to produce and were the output of eight
              people. That means each team member produced one thousand lines of
              code each week. That's the fastest of any team on record.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the elements of Borland team's “secret sauce” was that they
              would have everyone on the team meet every single day to discuss
              how they were performing. Getting everyone together in a room was
              key, because it gave the team the opportunity to self-organize
              around challenges. If someone was stuck with a problem, everyone
              saw that the impediment could block the whole Sprint, and they
              swarmed on it, making sure it got fixed pronto.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Borland the daily meeting was an hour at least. That struck me
              as too long, so I looked at the core things that need to be
              communicated in that huddle and came up with the three questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              And that's how the daily meeting came to operate. We had certain
              rules. The meeting was held at the same time every day, and
              everyone had to be there. If the entire team wasn't present,
              communication simply didn't happen. And it didn't matter what time
              of day the meeting took place, as long as it was at the same time
              every day. The point was to give the team a regular heartbeat.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second rule was that the meeting couldn't last more than
              fifteen minutes. We wanted it to be crisp, direct, and to the
              point. If something required further discussion, we noted it and
              met further after the daily meeting. The idea was to get the most
              actionable and valuable information in the least amount of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third rule was that everyone had to actively participate. To
              help this happen, I said that everyone had to stand up. That way
              there'd be active talking and listening going on. It also would
              keep the meetings short.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the reason such a meeting is often called the Daily
              Stand-up or Daily Scrum. It doesn't really matter what you call
              it. It has to be at the same time every day, with the same three
              questions, with everyone standing up, and last no more than
              fifteen minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem that I frequently see crop up is that people have a
              tendency to treat the Daily Stand-up as simply individual
              reporting. “I did this . . . I'll do that”—then on to the next
              person. The more optimum approach is closer to a football huddle.
              A wide receiver might say, “I'm having a problem with that
              defensive lineman,” to which an offensive blocker might respond,
              “I'll take care of that. I'll open that line.” The idea is for the
              team to quickly confer on how to move toward victory—i.e.,
              complete the Sprint. Passivity is not only lazy, it actively hurts
              the rest of the team's performance. Once spotted, it needs to be
              eliminated immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want aggressive teams—ones that come out of the daily meeting
              knowing the most important thing they need to accomplish that day.
              One person will hear another say that a task will take them a day,
              but another team member might know how to do it in an hour if they
              work together. I want teams emerging from that meeting saying
              things like, “Let's nail this. Let's do this.” The team needs to
              want to be great.
            </p>
            <p>
              My standard speech to teams large and small is: “Do you really
              want to suck forever? Is that what your motivation is in life?
              Because it's a choice, you know—you don't have to be that way.” A
              team has to demand greatness from itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Easel, with the first Scrum team, we implemented the Daily
              Stand-up during the third Sprint. We'd planned out four weeks of
              work for that Sprint—pretty much the same workload as the previous
              month. We finished it all in a week. A 400-percent improvement.
              That first Friday the whole team just looked around at one another
              and said, “Wow.” That's when I knew I might be on to something."
