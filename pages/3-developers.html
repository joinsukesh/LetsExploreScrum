            Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to
            creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
            <br />
            The term "Developers" is not used in the narrow sense of those who
            write code, but in the broad sense of those who develop the product.
            This could include activities such as design, coding, testing, etc.
            Scrum uses the term "Developers" not to exclude but to simplify.
            <br />
            The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad, and
            will vary with the domain of work. In Scrum, the Developers are
            cross-functional. In other words, the sum of the skills of all the
            Developers must be enough to deliver all the aspects of a usable
            product.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each Developer should have the flexibility to take on tasks based on
            their skills, expertise, and capacity during the Sprint.
            <br />
            A Developer never becomes solely accountable for the value of a
            Product Backlog item selected for the Sprint. The Developers
            collectively own the work, and collaborate to complete the Sprint
            Backlog items, and to achieve the Sprint Goal.

              for the Sprint (Sprint Backlog)
            </strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Developers are responsible for the estimation of effort
                required to complete a Product Backlog item. This information
                helps in capacity planning and determining the Sprint Backlog
                and Sprint Goal during Sprint Planning.
              </li>
              <li>
                They actively participate in Sprint Planning to establish a
                Sprint Backlog, which includes defining the Sprint Goal,
                selecting the Product Backlog items that they will work on, and
                creating a plan for completing these items, including a
                Definition of Done.<br />
                This self-selection process reinforces their autonomy and allows
                them to commit to a realistic and achievable scope of work for
                each Sprint, based on their understanding of their capacity, and
                the Product Owner's input on value and priorities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developers are responsible for managing the Sprint Backlog. This
                involves breaking down user stories or tasks into smaller,
                manageable pieces.
              </li>
              <li>
                It's up to the Developers to see how many items they can develop
                during the Sprint.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ultimately, the Developers have the autonomy and authority to
                make decisions related to the Sprint Backlog, and the
                implementation of the work.

                Developers conform to the DoD, and ensure that the product
                increment meets the quality standards set by the team. The DoD
                outlines the criteria for an increment to be considered
                complete. It encompasses aspects like coding standards, testing,
                documentation, and integration.
