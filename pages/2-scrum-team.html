            The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people, a Scrum
            Team.
            <br />
            Scrum defines three specific accountabilities within the Scrum Team:
            the <i>Developers</i>, the <i>Product Owner</i>, and the
            <i>Scrum Master</i>.
            <br />
            None of the these accountabilities are necessarily full-time. One
            person could take on multiple roles or the same role in multiple
            teams.
            <br />
            Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a
            cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time,
            the Product Goal.

          <h3 class="heading">SIZE OF A SCRUM TEAM</h3>
          <p>
            The Scrum Guide does not define a specific size for Scrum Teams.
            Instead, it suggests that a Scrum Team should be small enough to
            remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a
            Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people.
            <br />
            The size may vary depending on the nature of the work, complexity of
            the product, and the required skills and expertise.
            <br />
            In general, it is observed that smaller teams communicate better,
            and are more productive.
            <br />
            If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing
            into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same
            product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product
            Backlog, and Product Owner.

          <h3 class="heading">RESPONSIBILITIES OF A SCRUM TEAM</h3>
          <p>
            The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities
            from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance,
            operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything
            else that might be required.
            <br />The team works in Sprints at a sustainable pace, which
            improves its focus and consistency. <br />The entire Scrum Team is
            accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint.

          <h3 class="heading">QUALITIES OF A SCRUM TEAM</h3>
          <p>Scrum Teams are self-managed, and cross-functional.</p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-patch-check-fill"></i>&nbsp;Self-Managed</strong
            >
            <br />
            Being self-managed means that the team has the ability to organize,
            and regulate its own work without constant external supervision.
            Self-managed teams take ownership of their tasks, make decisions
            collectively, and adapt to changing circumstances. They don't rely
            on a manager to dictate every step; instead, they collaborate and
            find solutions independently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scrum promotes self-management in several ways. One way is by
            allowing the Scrum Team to decide who does what, when, and how.
            Another way is by removing titles for Scrum Team members, except for
            the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers, which encourages
            collaboration and shared responsibility to make decisions on the
            best approach to deliver value.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-patch-check-fill"></i>&nbsp;Cross-Functional
            </strong>
            <br />
            Cross-functional teams possess a diverse set of skills and expertise
            necessary to deliver a complete product increment.
            <br />
            Rather than having specialized roles (e.g., only developers, only
            testers), cross-functional teams include members with various
            skillsâ€”such as development, testing, design, and more. This
            diversity enables them to handle end-to-end tasks within a Sprint.
            <br />
            Not every member needs to be an expert in every aspect of the
            development process. Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the
            members collectively have all the skills necessary to create value
            each Sprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            In cases where the problem at hand is too complex for the Developers
            to figure out on their own, the Scrum Master can collaborate with
            them, potentially arranging specialized training or having a
            specialist join the Scrum Team when their expertise is required.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            <i class="bi bi-patch-check-fill"></i>&nbsp;Trust is essential for
            Scrum's success. Team members must trust each other to collaborate
            effectively, deliver value, and make decisions together. Trust
            creates transparency, open communication, and a safe environment for
            experimentation, and learning. Without trust, collaboration suffers,
            and the team's ability to self-organize, and deliver high-quality
            work may be impacted.

          <h3 class="heading">HOW TO FORM A SCRUM TEAM</h3>
          <p>
            They are structured, and empowered by the organization to manage
            their own work. Scrum values self-management, and autonomy.
            <br />
            One way to form Scrum Teams that align with these values is to bring
            all individuals together, and allow them to self-organize into
            teams.
            <br />
            Another way is to allow existing teams to suggest how they would
            like to organize themselves into the new structure.
            <br />
            Both of these methods give individuals a voice in the process, and
            empower them to take ownership of their work.

          <p>
            Typically, the Product Owner shares the product vision, goals, and
            context with the team, and answer any questions they might have. The
            team ensures that they have a clear and shared understanding of what
            'Done' means for their product, investing enough time in creating
            the <i>Definition of Done</i>.

          <h3 class="heading">CHANGES IN MEMBERSHIP</h3>
          <p>
            Scrum has no restrictions on changing the Scrum Team's membership,
            but it can have implications.
            <br />Adding new team members can decrease productivity initially
            due to time required for familiarization. Changing team composition
            can temporarily disrupt processes, and dynamics. <br />While
            productivity may increase in the long term, it's not necessarily
            linear, as more people can lead to increased communication channels,
            reducing capacity. <br />Having stable teams is advantageous, as
            they are more likely to evolve into high-performing teams, achieve
            enhanced productivity, and promote continuous improvement over the
            long term. <br />However, necessary changes should be made to ensure
            the team's long-term success, and while doing so, it is wise to
            consider a short-term reduction in productivity.
