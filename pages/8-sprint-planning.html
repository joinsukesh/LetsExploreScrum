            Sprint Planning is an essential event in the Scrum framework,
            designed to set the direction for the upcoming Sprint.

          <p>
            The main objective of this event is to determine what can be
            delivered in this Sprint and how that work will be achieved.
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading">TIMEFRAME</h3>
          <p>
            Sprint Planning occurs at the beginning of each Sprint. It is
            timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For
            shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

          <h3 class="heading">PARTICIPANTS</h3>
          <p>
            It's a collaborative effort involving the entire Scrum Team: the
            Product Owner (PO), the Development Team, and the Scrum Master. The
            Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to
            provide advice. The Scrum Master facilitates this event, ensuring
            that it stays focused and productive.

          <h3 class="heading">AGENDA</h3>
          <p>
            Sprint Planning addresses the following topics:
            <br /><br />
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-1-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;Topic One: Why is this
              Sprint valuable?</strong
            >
            <br />
            The PO proposes how the product could increase its value and utility
            in the current Sprint.
            <br />
            The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that
            communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint
            Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.
            <br /><br />
            The Sprint Goal is a short statement that describes what the
            Development Team aims to achieve during the Sprint.
            <br /><br />
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-2-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;Topic Two: What can be
              Done this Sprint?</strong
            >
            <br />
            Through discussion with the PO, the Developers select items from the
            Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint. The Scrum Team may
            refine these items during this process, which increases
            understanding and confidence.
            <br />
            Selecting how much can be completed within a Sprint may be
            challenging. However, the more the Developers know about their past
            performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done
            (DoD), the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.
            <br /><br />
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-3-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;Topic Three: How will
              the chosen work get done?</strong
            >
            <br />
            For each selected Product Backlog item (PBI), the Developers plan
            the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the DoD. This
            is often done by decomposing PBIs into smaller work items of one day
            or less. How this is done is at the sole discretion of the
            Developers. No one else tells them how to turn PBIs into Increments
            of value.
            <br />
            The Sprint Goal, the PBIs selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for
            delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.

          <p>
            Individuals within the team have specific accountabilities during
            this Event:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>PO</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Makes sure that the attendees of the event have enough information
              about the most important PBIs, including how they support the
              Product Goal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Makes a proposal to the team about what they can develop that
              would be valuable for the stakeholders. The team must be able to
              complete the work during the course of the Sprint. The PO
              shouldn't propose how the developers create this value.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Entire Scrum Team</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In a collaborative manner, the team crafts a Sprint Goal that
              indicates why this Sprint will bring value to the stakeholders,
              including customers and users.
            </li>
            <li>
              This addresses topic one: "<i>Why is this Sprint Valuable?</i>"
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Developers</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Select the items in the Product Backlog to address in the current
              Sprint. This addresses topic two: "<i
                >What can be done during this Sprint?</i
              >"
            </li>
            <li>
              When Developers select the PBIs for the Sprint, they consider:
            </li>
            <ul style="list-style: circle">
              <li>The Product Backlog, including the Product Goal.</li>
              <li>
                The Team's assessment of their capacity, based on their past
                performance in previous Sprints.
              </li>
              <li>The DoD.</li>
              <li>The current Increment, and</li>
              <li>
                Any process improvement suggestions that emerged during the
                team's Sprint Retrospectives.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Create a plan for how to fulfill the PBIs. This addresses topic
              three: "<i>How will this work get Done?</i>"
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Scrum Master</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Has specific accountabilities during the Sprint Planning event for
              helping the team fulfill the requirements of the event. For
              example, the Scrum Master guides the team if they see that PBIs
              aren't sufficiently defined, the team doesn't identify potential
              impediments, the Sprint Goal doesn't support the Product Goal or
              the team has selected an unattainable amount of work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Often the Scrum Master acts as the facilitator for this event,
              though this is not required. Facilitation of Sprint Planning can
              be done by anyone at the event.

          <h3 class="heading">ANTIPATTERNS</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose, timebox and participants of Sprint Planning are well
            defined. However, we sometimes see Scrum Teams fall into
            antipatterns that diminish their value.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong

                ><i class="bi bi-exclamation-lg"></i>Unavailable PO</strong
              >
              - If the PO, or their delegate, doesn't participate in Sprint
              Planning, the Developers must step in and based on their
              understanding fulfill all the accountabilities of the PO.
              Unfortunately, they are unlikely to have all the information a PO
              has that allows them to determine what makes this Sprint and each
              PBI more valuable relative to others on the Backlog. This
              situation puts undue burden on the Developers and the stakeholders
              and may result in the wrong product being developed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                ><i class="bi bi-exclamation-lg"></i>PBIs and Sprint Goal are

              >
              - In the course of implementing a PBI, Developers may make
              countless decisions and tradeoffs. Without understanding the value
              of what they are creating, they are likely to make bad decisions.

                Refinement</strong
              >
              - Without adequate Refinement, the Developers make assumptions
              such as: the value of each PBI; what the stakeholders are asking
              for and why they are asking for it; the acceptance criteria for
              the PBI; and their ability to complete the work on each PBI in one
              Sprint. This puts the success of the Sprint in jeopardy.

              >
              - If the PBIs do not have sufficient information for the
              Developers to understand what is being requested, it is likely
              that the result of their work will not fulfill the stakeholders'
              desires, wasting everyone's time.

              efficient and effective these meetings are. Sprint Planning
