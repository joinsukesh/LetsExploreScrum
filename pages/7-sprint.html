            Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into
            value. During a Sprint, the Scrum Team works to complete a set of
            product backlog items (PBIs) that contribute to the Sprint Goal.
            Each Sprint may be considered a short project. All the work
            necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning,
            Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within
            Sprints.

          <h3 class="heading">DURATION</h3>
          <p>
            Sprints are fixed length events of one month or less to create
            consistency. The team must define the Sprint's length before
            starting it, which means that it must be done before the Sprint
            Planning meeting. The length of a Sprint is decided collaboratively
            by the Scrum Team, considering factors like product complexity,
            stakeholder feedback, historical data, and organizational
            constraints. This decision-making process involves open discussions
            and consensus-building within the team. The goal is to select a
            Sprint duration that allows for consistent delivery of value while
            promoting collaboration, transparency, and adaptability within the
            Scrum framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a Sprint begins, its duration remains fixed and cannot be
            extended or shortened. The Sprint's duration remains consistent
            throughout the project. Regardless of completed work, the Sprint
            ends when the time-boxed period concludes. This time-boxing aspect
            ensures predictability, consistency, and focused effort within the
            development process, preventing scope creep and encouraging the
            delivery of incremental value. When a Sprint's horizon is too long
            the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk
            may increase. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more
            learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time
            frame. The team experiments and adapts as necessary, evaluating its
            effectiveness over time.

            </li>
            <li>
              The Product Owner (PO) collaborates with stakeholders and the
              Scrum Team to update the Product Backlog, ensuring that it remains
              current, prioritized, and aligned with the overall product vision.

            <li>
              The PO works closely with the team to review and refine the scope

              A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the
              previous Sprint. This establishes a regular rhythm for
              development, providing stakeholders with consistent updates and
              product increments, aiding in better planning and decision-making.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sprints enable predictability by ensuring that the Scrum Team
              inspects and adapts toward the <strong>Product Goal</strong> and
              <strong>Sprint Goal</strong> each Sprint. <br /><br />
              <p>
                <strong>Product Goal</strong> - The Product Goal describes a
                future state of the product which can serve as a target for the
                Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product
                Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define
                “what” will fulfill the Product Goal. The Product Goal is the
                long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or
                abandon) one objective before taking on the next.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Sprint Goal</strong> - The Sprint Goal is the single
                objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a
                commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms
                of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also
                creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work
                together rather than on separate initiatives.

          <h3 class="heading">EMPIRICISM</h3>
          <p>
            Empiricism is the most important practice for the Scrum Team to
            embrace during the Sprint. There is a lot unknown in complex
            environments. By embracing empiricism the team will learn by doing
            and will continue to improve as you navigate complex work.
            <br />
            Forward looking decisions can only be made by the Scrum Team based
            on what has already happened.
            <br />
            Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs,
            burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While proven useful, these do not
            replace the importance of empiricism.

          <h3 class="heading">PREREQUISITES FOR STARTING A SPRINT</h3>
          <p>
            Prior to initiating the initial Sprint, two critical prerequisites
            must be met.
            <br />
            1. Firstly, there should be a sufficient number of PBIs ready for
            commencement, each adequately refined and detailed for Developer
            action.
            <br />
            2. Secondly, the establishment of a cross-functional Scrum Team is
            essential, comprising the PO, Developers, and Scrum Master,
            possessing all requisite skills for product development.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row mt-2">
        <div class="col">
          <h3 class="heading">MANAGING WORK CHANGES DURING SPRINT</h3>
          <p>
            If any stakeholder requests additional work from the Developers
            during a Sprint, it is crucial for them to promptly inform the PO.
            The PO is responsible for managing the Product Backlog and
            determining the priority and sequence of work. The Sprint's focus is
            based on items chosen during Sprint Planning from the Product
            Backlog. Introducing new tasks during a Sprint may disrupt the
            team's focus and commitment to the Sprint Goal.
            <br />
            Therefore, it is the responsibility of the PO to handle such
            requests and decide whether the new work should be included in the
            Product Backlog for future Sprints. While changing the Sprint scope
            is feasible, it necessitates discussions between the PO and
            Developers to assess whether such changes hinder the Sprint Goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            When there's surplus time available for Developers within the
            Sprint, it's advisable to jointly involve both Developers and the PO
            in selecting additional tasks. Developers possess insights into
            remaining capacity and technical feasibility, while the PO holds
            authority in prioritizing based on work value and importance.
            Through collaborative effort, both parties can decide which
            additional items from the Product Backlog can be addressed during
            the ongoing Sprint.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row mt-2">
        <div class="col">
          <h3 class="heading">
            WHAT HAPPENS TO UNFINISHED ITEMS AT THE END OF A SPRINT
          </h3>
          <p>
            It's acceptable to have unfinished items, as the Sprint Backlog
            serves as an estimate.
            <br />
            In cases where it becomes evident that not all forecasted PBIs can
            be completed within the Sprint, it's imperative for the Developers
            and the PO to engage in a discussion. This collaborative effort aims
            to gain a deeper understanding of the situation, assess current
            progress, and adjust plans if necessary.
            <br />
            Potential actions may include negotiating Sprint scope or reordering
            the Product Backlog. While the Scrum Master can facilitate this
            discussion, the primary dialogue should occur between the
            Developers, and the PO. Unfinished items revert to the Product
            Backlog, while events remain unaffected.

          <h3 class="heading">SPRINT CANCELLATION</h3>
          <p>
            Sprint cancellation in Scrum refers to the decision to prematurely
            end a Sprint before its planned duration. A Sprint could be
            cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete, due to various
            reasons, such as significant changes in market conditions, company
            strategy, or technology. The decision to cancel a Sprint should be
            made in exceptional circumstances when continuing the Sprint would
            not be in the best interest of the project or the product. It
            requires careful consideration and communication among the Scrum
            Team and stakeholders to ensure alignment and minimize disruptions
            to the development process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only the PO has the authority to cancel the Sprint, since they are
            responsible for maximizing the value of the product and determining
            the release strategy. If the decision is made to cancel a Sprint,
            the PO communicates this to the Scrum Team during the Sprint Review
            or as soon as the decision is made. The team then stops work on the
            Sprint backlog items and holds a Sprint Retrospective to reflect on
            the reasons for the cancellation and identify lessons learned. The
            PO may work with stakeholders to determine the next steps, such as
            re-prioritizing the Product Backlog or adjusting the Sprint
            duration.

              <br />
              As the product evolves, it may be appropriate to either lengthen
              or shorten the Sprint. However, frequently changing the length of
              the Sprint may indicate that the team is going back and forth
              between a desire to have less frequent meetings (Sprint Planning,
              Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective) and their realization that
              they need more frequent feedback from stakeholders.

              <br />
              Specialized Sprints (such as design, analysis or testing Sprints)
              generally indicate that something is wrong in the team's
              understanding of Scrum. For example:
              <p>
                <strong>Sprint 0</strong> - Some teams create a “Sprint 0” which
                is a Sprint before the formal start of the project. When a team
                suggests having a Sprint 0, it may be because they feel they
                must create some artifacts (such as a Product Backlog and the
                Definition of Done), or resolve some procedural or technical
                questions (such as what tools to use in developing the product)
                before Sprinting. However, the essence of Scrum is to be able to
                start with complex problems and to incrementally and iteratively
                solve them. There is no such thing as “Sprint 0,” it's just a
                “Sprint.”
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Hardening Sprint</strong> - Some teams create a
                “hardening” Sprint which is dedicated to improving the quality
                of the product. If the team feels it's necessary to have a
                “hardening” Sprint, it's often because they haven't taken care
                in creating, evolving and conforming to their Definition of
                Done. They typically take on too much work and don't have the
                time to create a high-quality result. There should not be
                “hardening” Sprints. Instead, in early Sprints the Definition of
                Done may be less stringent and over the course of many Sprints,
                the Definition of Done may become increasingly stringent,
                forcing later Sprints to have higher quality expectations rather
                than abruptly creating a Sprint to rectify the quality issues.
              </p>

              >
              <br />
              The beginning of the Sprint is used for solution development. Near
              the end of the Sprint timeframe, all of the work goes into a
              testing phrase.

              <br />
              Often, teams use a board to visualize the state of each Sprint
              Backlog item. At a minimum, these states are “To Do,” “In
              Progress,” “Blocked” or “Done.” This antipattern results when
              Developers select the PBIs they intend to work on at the beginning
              of the Sprint and put them all in the “doing/in progress” state.

          <p>
            Breaking the antipatterns listed above help create strong and
            effective Sprints. Consider the following tips:

          <ul style="list-style: none">
            <li>
              <i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;A two-week Sprint may
              be a good starting point for determining the Sprint length. If
              PBIs cannot be made small enough to fit into a two-week Sprint or
              Sprint Goals cannot be defined so that they can be achieved in two
              weeks, consider lengthening the Sprint. Shorter Sprints are
              beneficial because they provide opportunities for more frequent
              feedback and adaptation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;Keep the length of
              the Sprint as consistent as possible. Sometimes teams increase the
              length of the Sprint during vacation periods, often to keep their
              “velocity” consistent across Sprints. However, velocity is a poor
              measure of value creation. Teams should simply reduce the amount
              of work they forecast during periods of high absenteeism.
