            Technical debt is a metaphor used to explain to non-technical
            stakeholders the repercussions of subpar software development
            practices. It encompasses issues like code decay, architectural
            deterioration, and shortcomings in design documentation and testing.
            <br />Essentially, high technical debt means that the code is
            difficult to work with and changing it comes with significant costs.
            This contradicts the Agile principle of being responsive to change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Technical debt can obscure the true state of a product by concealing
            underlying issues or flawed designs, potentially impeding a team's
            productivity as resources are redirected to rectify earlier
            suboptimal decisions. Neglecting technical debt can escalate
            maintenance expenses, diminish productivity, and compromise the
            team's capacity to deliver value to customers efficiently
          </p>
          <p>
            The Scrum Guide doesn't explicitly address technical debt, but it
            emphasizes sustainable pace and continuous improvement. While it is
            ideal for a Scrum Team to minimize technical debt, it is not
            realistic to expect a Scrum Team to have no technical debt. The
            Scrum Team should prioritize and address technical debt when it
            becomes necessary and impacts the ability to deliver value.
          </p>

          <p>
            There's no fixed timeframe for addressing technical debt in Scrum.
            It's up to the team to decide when and how to tackle it, considering
            their goals and standards for the product.
            <br />
            One way to limit the accumulation of technical debt is by having an
            appropriate Definition of Done. The Definition of Done sets the
            quality criteria that must be met for a Product Backlog item to be
            considered complete. By continuously refining and improving the
            Definition of Done, the Scrum Team ensures that each Increment is
            thoroughly tested, integrated, and meets the required quality
            standards, reducing the chances of accumulating technical debt.
