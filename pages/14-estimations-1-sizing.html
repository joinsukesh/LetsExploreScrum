            In traditional project management, time estimation is typically
            assigned to each individual task. However, in Agile methodologies,
            this approach isn't favored due to the considerable effort involved,
            and the tendency for resulting estimates to be inaccurate. The
            larger the task being estimated, the more challenging it becomes for
            us as humans to accurately gauge its size. So, what's the
            alternative? The concept of relative sizing comes into play.

          <h3 class="heading">RELATIVE SIZING</h3>
          <p>
            Relative sizing (or just Sizing in short) is a technique used in
            Agile project management to estimate the size or complexity of tasks
            or user stories relative to one another, rather than assigning
            specific time durations or absolute values to each task. It involves
            comparing different tasks or user stories based on their perceived
            complexity, effort, or size.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sizing helps the Scrum Team understand the relative size of each
            item, which aids in planning and prioritization. It allows the team
            to forecast how much work they can complete within a given Sprint
            and helps in determining the team's velocity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scrum does not prescribe any rules about estimates and there are a
            lot of possibilities, but the most popular measure unit is the
            <i>Story Point</i>, which is an Agile alternative to hours and days.
            And the most used estimation technique is <i>Planning Poker</i>.
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading">STORY POINTS</h3>
          <p>
            Story points are a unit of measure used to estimate the overall
            effort required to implement a user story. Instead of estimating in
            hours, team members assign story points based on factors like
            complexity, uncertainty, and effort required.
          </p>
          <p>
            The semi-Fibonacci series is often used for sizing tasks during the
            estimation process, particularly when estimating user stories using
            story points. It is a modified version of the Fibonacci sequence.
            <br />The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each
            subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers (0, 1, 1,
            2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the semi-Fibonacci scale, the sequence follows a similar pattern
            but with some modifications. Instead of strictly adhering to the
            Fibonacci sequence, it incorporates some increments or deviations to
            better suit the needs of the team. For example, it might include
            values like 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            This modified scale is used for sizing tasks because it provides a
            more nuanced range of values than a linear scale, allowing for
            better differentiation between the sizes or complexities of tasks.
            By using a semi-Fibonacci scale, teams can more accurately assess
            and prioritize tasks based on their relative sizes, making it easier
            to plan and allocate resources effectively in Agile project
            management.

          <h3 class="heading">PLANNING POKER</h3>
          <p>
            Planning Poker is a collaborative estimation technique used in Agile
            and Scrum methodologies to estimate the relative size or effort
            required to complete a specific task, user story, or feature. It is
            typically employed during Sprint Planning sessions to facilitate the
            process of determining the effort involved in completing the items
            in the Product Backlog.
          </p>
          <p>Here's how Planning Poker typically works:</p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-1-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;Preparation:</strong
            >
            Before the planning poker session, the Product Owner (PO) prepares a
            list of user stories or backlog items to be estimated. These are
            typically written on index cards or displayed on a screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-2-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;Participants:</strong
            >
            Estimates in Scrum are made by those doing the work, which in this
            case would be the Developers. The Developers have the best
            understanding of the effort and complexity involved in completing a
            Product Backlog item (PBI) and are, therefore, best positioned to
            provide accurate estimates. While the PO may provide input and
            guidance, ultimately, it is up to the Developers to estimate the
            work. The Scrum Master can support this process by facilitating
            discussions and helping the team to reach a shared understanding of
            the work involved. The team should ideally consist of individuals
            with diverse perspectives and expertise relevant to the tasks being
            estimated.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-3-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;Card Decks:</strong
            >
            Each participant is given a set of cards with values representing
            different levels of effort or complexity. These values are typically
            based on the semi-Fibonacci sequence (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,
            20, 40, etc.) The cards are usually numbered or labeled to
            correspond to these values.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-4-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;Estimation
              Process:</strong
            >
            The PO presents one backlog item at a time to the team. The team
            discusses the item and asks clarifying questions if needed. Once
            everyone understands the scope of the item, each participant selects
            a card from their deck representing their estimate of the effort
            required to complete the item.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><i class="bi bi-5-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;Reveal and
              Discussion:</strong
            >
            Once everyone has selected a card, all participants reveal their
            chosen card simultaneously. If there is a wide range of estimates,
            participants discuss their reasoning and any differing perspectives
            on the item. This discussion helps the team align their
            understanding and reach a consensus on the estimate. If, for
            instance, someone estimated a 3 and the other one an 8, these
            members will have to show their reasons. After they discuss the team
            goes to another round of estimation until consensus is reached.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><i class="bi bi-6-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;Repeat:</strong>
            The process is repeated for each backlog item until all items have
            been estimated. If there are particularly complex items or
            significant discrepancies in estimates, additional discussion and
            rounds of estimation may be necessary.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The goal of Planning Poker is to reach a consensus estimate for each
            backlog item. This consensus estimate represents the team's
            collective understanding of the effort involved and provides a basis
            for prioritizing and planning the work in the upcoming sprint.

          <h3 class="heading">HOW DO YOU START ESTIMATING</h3>
          <p>
            As a rule of thumb, during the first Planning Poker session, the
            team will select the smallest PBI, which is a really easy one that
            the team could get done in a few days. And then give it a 2. Why
            give it a 2 and not a 1? Because we leave room for smaller items
            that can come up in the future. So after giving the first user story
            a 2, the team can estimate the remaining ones in comparison to that
            one.

          <h3 class="heading">ONLY A TEAM METRIC</h3>
          <p>
            A story point is a team metric, and we can never compare the
            productivity of teams using story points.
            <br />The allocation of story points in Agile teams is influenced by
            factors such as team expertise and task complexity. For instance,
            Team A, familiar with augmented reality, might assign a backlog item
            5 points, while another team less experienced in the same area might
            assign 13 points due to perceived risk. Similarly, different
            technology domains like blockchain may lead to varied estimates;
            Team B might rate a task at 8 points, whereas Team A might assign 40
            points. This illustrates that story point allocation isn't
            indicative of team speed but reflects the unique challenges and
            proficiencies of each team.

          <h3 class="heading">CONCLUSION</h3>
          <p>
            Sizing is an important aspect of Scrum because it helps in creating
            realistic Sprint plans, managing expectations, and providing
            transparency to stakeholders regarding the team's capacity and
            progress. However, it is crucial to understand that story points or
            sizing estimates are not fixed values but rather relative measures
            that evolve as the team gains more understanding and experience with
            the project.
