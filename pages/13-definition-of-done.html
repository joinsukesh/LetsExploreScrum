            In agile development, each Increment shapes future progress. Poor
            quality in one Sprint can hinder productivity. As each Sprint draws
            to a close, the team's focus shifts to delivering Increments that
            meet the criteria of "Done," a term that can vary in interpretation
            among team members.
            <br />To mitigate ambiguity and foster a shared understanding of
            completion, Scrum Teams establish a Definition of Done (DoD). A
            strong DoD is vital for the success of Scrum, ensuring a balance
            between speed and quality.

          <h3 class="heading">WHAT IS DoD</h3>
          <p>
            The DoD, as the name implies, defines the quality standards an
            Increment must meet to be considered finished. It is a formal
            description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality
            measures required for the product. The moment a Product Backlog item
            (PBI) meets the DoD, an Increment is born. DoD should not be
            confused with User Story Acceptance Criteria. The Acceptance
            Criteria are specific to individual stories. But the DoD
            encapsulates the overall quality expectations for the entire
            Increment.

          <h3 class="heading">WHO DEFINES THE DoD</h3>
          <p>
            The DoD is closely tied to quality and is set by the development
            organization. Established organizations maintain standards,
            conventions, and guidelines to regulate their work, ensuring goal
            achievement. Every project or initiative must align with these
            standards. In some cases, the organization's quality standards align
            with external benchmarks. If it is not an organizational standard,
            the Scrum Team must create a DoD appropriate for the product. If
            there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they
            must mutually define and comply with the same DoD.

              <strong>A Short, Measurable Checklist:</strong> The DoD should
              consist of items that are concise, measurable, and testable,
              allowing for clear verification of completion. The criteria might
              also be related to architecture, non-functional/system
              requirements, process management, configuration management,
              performance, security, maintainability, and usability and so on.

              quality standards.

            If a PBI does not meet the DoD, it cannot be released or even
            presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product
            Backlog for future consideration.

          <h3 class="heading">WHEN TO REVIEW THE DoD</h3>
          <p>
            The DoD should not be considered a static document, but should
            undergo regular reviews and adjustments based on the evolving
            insights of the Scrum Team. It should evolve as the team's knowledge
            of the product grows and as the product itself evolves.
            <br />The Sprint Retrospective is the ideal occasion to assess and
            refine the DoD. Therefore, introducing new criteria may lead the
            team to realize the need for additional work in previously completed
            Increments. Nonetheless, teams can discuss and modify the DoD more
            frequently if needed. <br />The crucial aspect is to foster open
            communication within the team to ensure that the DoD accurately
            reflects the necessary criteria for building a usable and
            potentially releasable Increment.
