            Scrum's artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to
            maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting
            them has the same basis for adaptation. There are three artifacts in
            Scrum - The <i>Product Backlog</i>, the <i>Sprint Backlog</i>, and
            the <i>Increment</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides
            information that enhances transparency and focus against which
            progress can be measured:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For the <i>Product Backlog</i> it is the
              <i style="color: dimgray; font-weight: 500">Product Goal</i>
            </li>
            <li>
              For the <i>Sprint Backlog</i> it is the
              <i style="color: dimgray; font-weight: 500">Sprint Goal</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the <i>Increment</i> it is the
              <i style="color: dimgray; font-weight: 500"
                >Definition of Done (DoD)</i
              >.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These commitments are not optional but a crucial aspect of Scrum.
            They exist to reinforce empiricism, and the Scrum values for the
            Scrum Team and their stakeholders.

          <h3 class="heading">PRODUCT BACKLOG</h3>
          <p>
            The Product Backlog is a dynamic, prioritized list of all the
            features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other work items that
            represent the requirements for the product, regardless of their size
            or complexity. These items are typically expressed as user stories,
            features, epics, or any other format that helps convey the desired
            functionality or outcome. The Product Backlog serves as the single
            source of truth for what needs to be built, maintained, or improved
            in the product. It is owned and maintained by the Product Owner
            (PO), who is responsible for ensuring that it reflects the current
            understanding of the product requirements and priorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Product Backlog items (PBIs) that can be Done by the Scrum Team
            within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint
            Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency
            after refining activities.

          <h4>Product Backlog Refinement</h4>
          <p>
            Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further
            defining PBIs into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing
            process in which the PO collaborates with the Scrum Team and
            stakeholders to clarify, decompose, and estimate PBIs.
            <br />
            During backlog refinement sessions, the team discusses and
            elaborates on PBIs to ensure that they are sufficiently detailed and
            understood by everyone. This may involve breaking down large items
            into smaller ones, adding acceptance criteria, and identifying any
            dependencies or risks.
            <br />The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for
            the sizing. The PO may influence the Developers by helping them
            understand and select trade-offs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of backlog refinement is to ensure that the Product Backlog
            is always ready for the next sprint planning session, with the
            highest-priority items sufficiently refined and estimated. Items in
            the Product Backlog are ordered based on their priority, with the
            most valuable or critical items placed at the top. The priority is
            determined by the PO in collaboration with stakeholders, considering
            factors such as business value, market demand, customer feedback,
            and technical dependencies.

          <h4>Commitment: <span style="color: dimgray">Product Goal</span></h4>
          <p>
            The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can
            serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. It is the
            <strong>long-term objective</strong> for the Scrum Team. They must
            fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next.
            <br />
            The PBIs define what will fulfill the Product Goal as the Scrum Team
            learns more about how to achieve the goal while working each Sprint.
            The Product Goal is therefore a simple directional statement that
            provides context and purpose (of the work) for the Scrum Team and
            its stakeholders.
            <br />
            The Product Goal is made
            <strong>transparent</strong> through the Product Backlog and the PO
            is accountable for the creating and communicating the Product Goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Product Backlog evolves over time as the Scrum Team learns both
            in how they work and the work that they are doing to achieve the
            Product Goal. They learn from feedback along with how they are
            building the product. There is only one Product Goal for the Product
            Backlog at any given time. The Product Goal should be
            <strong>clear and concise</strong>. As each Increment is produced,
            the Product moves toward the Product Goal by achieving each Sprint
            Goal along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and any invited
            stakeholders and/or customers will inspect the Increment. This
            encourages Sprint Reviews to put some context around their findings
            and ask questions about how much progress has been made towards the
            Product Goal. These findings influence Sprint Planning as they can
            help create focus and form decisions about the next Sprint.

          <h3 class="heading">SPRINT BACKLOG</h3>
          <p>
            During the Sprint Planning meeting, the Scrum Team collaborates to
            select a set of PBIs to work on during the Sprint. These items are
            chosen based on their priority, estimated effort, and the team's
            capacity. The Sprint Backlog is an artifact in Scrum that contains
            these items. It represents the work that the Development Team
            commits to completing within the Sprint in order to achieve the
            Sprint Goal.
            <br />The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the
            set of PBIs selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable
            plan for delivering the Increment (how).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a
            highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers
            plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint
            Goal. Consequently, the Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the
            Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that they
            can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum.
          </p>

      <div class="row mt-2">
        <div class="col">
          <h4>Commitment: <span style="color: dimgray">Sprint Goal</span></h4>
          <p>
            The Sprint Goal is the
            <strong>single objective for the Sprint</strong>. Although the
            Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides
            flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The
            Sprint Goal also creates <strong>cohesiveness and focus</strong>,
            encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate
            initiatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event by the
            <strong>Scrum Team</strong>, and then added to the Sprint Backlog.
            As the Developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal
            in mind. If the work evolves and is not what they expected (it is
            more or less complex than they thought, for example), they
            collaborate with the PO to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog
            within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal. <br />The
            Sprint Goal does not change during a Sprint. However, there are
            sometimes cases where the Scrum Team discovers something that
            invalidates the Sprint Goal. When that happens the context of the
            situation or the environment the team is working in will influence
            what happens next, including possibly canceling the Sprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            When creating a Sprint Goal, it is important to keep in mind that it
            should be clear as to what the Scrum Team is aiming to achieve
            during the Sprint. It is also important that the goal is attainable.
            As the Sprint Goal is in place to help create focus for the Scrum
            Team, the goal must be attainable and not too large or it will have
            the opposite impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scrum is about delivering value incrementally, so the Sprint Goal
            should be created with that in mind in order to maintain focus. It
            is also important for the Sprint Goal to be visible so that the
            Scrum Team does not lose sight of it. The purpose of the Daily Scrum
            is to inspect the progress toward the Sprint Goal, so it is
            important for Scrum Teams to maintain that practice.

          <h3 class="heading">INCREMENT</h3>
          <p>
            An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal.
            Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly
            verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to
            provide value, the Increment must be usable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the
            Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting
            empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders
            prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be
            considered a gate to releasing value.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Increment is potentially shippable, meaning that it meets the
            quality standards and requirements necessary for deployment to
            production or release to customers. While it may not always be
            practical or desirable to release every increment to users, the goal
            is to have the option to do so if needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the
            DoD.

          </h4>
          <p>
            The DoD is a formal description of the state of the
            <strong>Increment</strong> when it meets the quality measures
            required for the product.
          </p>
          <p>The moment a PBI meets the DoD, an Increment is born.</p>
          <p>
            The DoD creates <strong>transparency</strong> by providing everyone
            a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the
            Increment. If a PBI does not meet the DoD, it cannot be released or
            even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the
            Product Backlog for future consideration.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the DoD for an increment is part of the standards of the
            organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is
            not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a DoD
            appropriate for the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Developers are required to conform to the DoD. If there are
            multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must
            mutually define and comply with the same DoD.
          </p>
          <p>We'll learn more about the DoD in the next article.</p>

            The Scrum artifacts collectively provide transparency, alignment,
            and focus for the Scrum Team and stakeholders throughout the product
            development process. They serve as essential tools for effective
            planning, execution, and inspection within the Scrum framework.
