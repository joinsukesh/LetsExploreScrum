            In the Scrum framework, the Sprint Retrospective is a dedicated
            meeting that occurs at the end of each sprint, just after the Sprint
            Review and before the next sprint planning session. It is timeboxed
            to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter
            Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
            <br />
            The Scrum Master facilitates the retrospective but ensures that it
            remains a collaborative effort involving the entire team.
            Additionally, the retrospective should provide a safe environment
            for team members to openly share their thoughts, feedback, and ideas
            without fear of blame or judgment.

          <p>
            The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase
            quality and effectiveness.
            <br />The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards
            to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition
            of Done. <br />Inspected elements often vary with the domain of
            work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their
            origins explored.
          </p>

      </div>
      <div class="row mt-2">
        <div class="col">
          <h3 class="heading">AGENDA</h3>
          <p>
            It's often the case that the Scrum Master assumes responsibility for
            facilitating the Sprint Retrospective, but it's certainly not
            required. In fact, in order to keep all members of the team engaged
            during Sprint Retrospectives, it's good practice for them to take
            turns acting as the facilitator for this event.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its
            effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon
            as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the
            next Sprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Scrum Master encourages the rest of the Scrum Team to improve
            its process and practices to make it more effective and enjoyable
            for the next Sprint. During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum
            Team plans ways to increase product quality by improving work
            processes or adapting the definition of “Done” if appropriate and
            not in conflict with product or organizational standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have
            identified improvements that it will implement in the next Sprint.
            Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is the adaptation
            to the inspection of the Scrum Team itself. Although improvements
            may be implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a
            formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation.
          </p>
          <p>A simple way to conduct the Sprint Retrospective is to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Set up a whiteboard with three sections:
              <ul style="list-style: circle">
                <li>What went well?</li>
                <li>What didn't go well</li>
                <li>What could be improved</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Ask each Scrum Team member to put a “sticky” note in the relevant
              sections
            </li>
            <li>Discuss each item</li>
            <li>
              Create a list of improvements that the team agrees should be
              undertaken
            </li>
            <li>
              Have the team order this list and pick the top 1 or 2 to work on
              in the next Sprint
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row mt-2">

          <h3 class="heading">COMMON ANTIPATTERNS</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose, timebox and participants of the Sprint Retrospective
            are well defined. However, Scrum Teams sometimes fall into
            antipatterns that diminish their value and waste everyone's time.
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style: none">
            <li>
              <strong
                ><i class="bi bi-exclamation-lg"></i>Scrum Team members do not
                actively participate</strong
              >
              - When Scrum Team members are passive during a Sprint
              Retrospective, the Scrum Master will often step in and pull
              information from the team, or will come up with their own list of
              areas for improvement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong

                during the Retrospective,</strong

              but team members grumble about them outside the meeting.

            <li>
              <strong
                ><i class="bi bi-exclamation-lg"></i>Participants do not recall
                issues that came up during the Sprint</strong

              so the issues are not raised during the Retrospective.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                ><i class="bi bi-exclamation-lg"></i>The team becomes
                complacent</strong

            <li>
              <strong
                ><i class="bi bi-exclamation-lg"></i>Lack of honesty and
                communication</strong
              >
              - Often because they'd like to minimize conflict or because there
              is a lack of trust on the team.
            </li>
            <li>

                changes</strong
              >
              - When the same impediments or ineffective team interactions are
              identified in multiple Sprint Retrospectives, it's an indicator
              that nothing is being done to rectify the problems or make
              improvements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong

                cannot improve</strong

              - Some teams spend too much time focused on items that are outside
              of the team's domain and influence.

                improved</strong
              >
              - This generally results in participants being unwilling to make
              further observations.

              <strong

              - Often this happens when the Product Owner acts as though they

              - Participants may find the Retrospective boring, stale, unfocused
              and a waste of time if they either don't plan how they will run
              the Retrospective or they mechanically follow a three question

          <p>
            Breaking the antipatterns listed above help create strong and
            effective Sprint Retrospectives. Consider the following tips:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style: none">
            <li>
              <strong><i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;</strong
              >&nbsp;Make certain that everyone participates and has a voice. Be
              cognizant of the communication differences among team members;
              some may be introverts and others may be extroverts. Also, if a
              team member acts in an unruly way, address the issue right away.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong><i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;</strong
              >&nbsp;Encourage an environment where team members are eager to
              improve their working environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong><i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;</strong
              >&nbsp;Encourage strong psychological safety and a culture of
              radical transparency and openness where every team member can be
              honest about issues in the team's working practices, even if they
              may create some (healthy) conflict.
            </li>

              <strong><i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;</strong

              or environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong><i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;</strong

              <strong><i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;</strong
              >&nbsp;If the team identifies an overwhelming number of
              improvement items, consider having the team prioritize the
              improvements and then improve on 1-2 each Sprint.

              team. Be transparent about the resolution status of those issues.

              <strong><i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;</strong

            The Sprint Retrospective serves as a mechanism for fostering a
            culture of continuous improvement within the Scrum Team. By
            regularly reflecting on their processes and practices, the team can
            incrementally enhance their performance and deliver more value over
            time.
